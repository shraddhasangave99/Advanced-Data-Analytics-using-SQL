# Advanced-Data-Analytics-using-SQL
This repository offers a well-structured collection of SQL scripts tailored for data exploration, analytics, and reporting. It encompasses a wide range of analyses, including database exploration, key measures and metrics, time-based trends, cumulative insights, and segmentation. Designed with data analysts and BI professionals in mind, the scripts enable efficient exploration, segmentation, and in-depth analysis of relational databases. Each query is crafted around a specific analytical objective while highlighting best practices in SQL. This makes the collection a practical resource for enhancing analytical workflows and generating actionable insights.

🎯 Task:- As a Data Analyst, I need to perform Exploratory Data Analysis to derive insights and interpret the findings with the use of different Advance Analytics techniques shown in image below, for which used the different functions in SQL such as Complex Queries, Aggregation, Window function, CTE, Subqueries and Views. So we will dive deep into each one, step by step.

## 1] Change over Time (Trends) Analysis
#### 🎯Purpose:
      A. To track trends, growth, and changes in key metrics over time.
      B. For time-series analysis and identifying seasonality.
      C. To measure growth or decline over specific periods.
##### 🚩Formula Used: ∑[Measure] by [Date Dimension]
##### 🔍SQL Task: Analyse Sales performance over time.

## 2] Cumulative Analysis
   Aggregates the data progressively over time. It helps to understand whether our business is growing or declining. We can track performance over time cumulatively. Used Aggregrate and Window functions.
##### 🚩Formula Used: ∑[Cumulative Measure] by [Date Dimension]
##### 🔍SQL Task: Calculate the total sales per month and the running total of sales over time.

## 3] Performance Analysis
   Aggregates the data progressively over time. It helps to understand whether our business is growing or declining. We can track performance over time cumulatively. Used Aggregrate and Window functions.
##### 🚩Formula Used: ∑[Cumulative Measure] by [Date Dimension]
##### 🔍SQL Task: Calculate the total sales per month and the running total of sales over time.
